## Why Abundance
In the most famous quote in the bible, behind only a bunch of christian religious mumbo jumbo, Ecclesiastes reads "There is a time for everything, and a season for every activity under the heavens." In the same vein, there is is a time to talk about Abundance. That time was about a month ago, when people still cared about it. 
I'm talking about it now instead, because I'm a rebel WITH a cause. WITH A CAUSE. You could say it's because I'm lazy and bad at time management, but that would be slander and I would sue you. I'm serious, don't do it. That hurts my fragile ego.
