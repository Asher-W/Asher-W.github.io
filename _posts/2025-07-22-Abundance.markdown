## The End of the Party
In the most famous quote in the bible, behind only a bunch of religious christian mumbo jumbo, Ecclesiastes reads "There is a time for everything, and a season for every activity under the heavens." In the same vein, there is is a time to talk about Abundance. That time was about a month ago, when people still cared about it. 
I'm talking about it now instead, because I'm a rebel WITH a cause. WITH A CAUSE. You could say it's because I'm lazy and bad at time management, but that would be slander and I would sue you. I'm serious, don't do it. That hurts my fragile ego.

This is all to say, I know I'm late to the party, but talking about the book is interesting, particularly because of its now slowing buzz. Many people have discused the book, though I'm inclined to believe that far fewer have sat down and read it, not just because people today are reading less and less, but also because it sounds boring -- it's an economics book, what could be less enticing? This article will be an outline of the book, as well as my thoughts on its content.

## Picking Abundance
Just about a month ago, I was arguing with my mother about Zohran Mamdani's policies, which I am very excited to see implemented. She said he was part of the "Abundance crowd" of people with ideas taken from or similar to the book. Knowing she hadn't read it, I asked what values the book espoused. All she could muster was "politics," and I wasn't much better. She wouldn't admit she didn't know what the book was about, and I wouldn't admit the other way, so we each got the book to settle our feud. She finished first, and I did soon after, but by then the tiff had died down.

A few days later, I was talking to my [friend](https://j-nac.github.io/2025/07/19/when-there-are-no-other-options.html) about the book. He admitted to me in confidence that he owned the book and had never read it. What's more, because he is completely illiterate, with a brain addled by trash tv, he asked me to write an article so he wouldn't have to get through the book. Since I am a kind, caring, altruous pal to my good [buddy](https://j-nac.github.io/2025/05/12/exact-odes.html), we're here now.

## Getting Through the Book
It really must be said, Abundance, by Ezra Klein and Eric Thompson, is not the most complicated book in the world; far from it. It opens on a day in the authors' ideal future that feels straight from a YA sci-fi novel's okay fanfiction. In the first real line of the book, the authors say the following: 

>This book is dedicated to a simple idea: to have the future we want, we need to build and invent more of what we need. That's it. That's the thesis.

>It reads, even to us, as too simple.

This book is meant to be read, and read by everyone. It is no coincidence that a book like this would started a movement. This article is, in now way, a proper replacement for the actual book. So if you're reading this (especially [you](https://j-nac.github.io/2025/05/30/potential-buffer-overflows.html)) please actually read the book.

With that out of the way, lets begin. The book has five large sections plus an open and end. These are: Introduction, Grow, Build, Govern, Invent, Deploy, and Conclusion. From here till otherwise noted, the points are from the book, with editorializing by me.

### Introduction
The point of the book is simple, and they say it many times. Society is not broken, at least not in the traditional sense. Scarcity is a choice that we have made, and it is a decision we can change. 

The book here firmly sets itself as a letter to democrats, a so-called leftist party scared off of leftist policy, so bent to conservative whims that they repeat the right's talking point. For fear of being labeled socialist, democrats cut government to instead pass around ineffectual handouts. These handouts increase demand for goods, but without more made, prices (of healthcare, college, everything) just go up. Yet the markets won't always meet people's needs, so the government must do something. To grow more than before, we have to change culture and develop new fields, and that takes work. It takes research that we aren't doing. Our party must look to the future and allow government to be effective if we hope to regain the populace's trust.

### Grow
Cities are extremely important to development. They gather the best minds to make progress in teams, they store industrial expertice in an easy to access bank, and they are fonts of social mobility. If we want to develop, we need them to thrive. But today, no one can afford them.

Seventy years ago, America was disgusting, was ugly, was killing its people off like clay pigeons at a shooting range. Fewer than ten years after laws were passed to address this issue, they became yet more tools to block development of housing.

We build less homes per capita than most other countries, and what we build is absurdly expensive. Housing is an asset that makes up most of its owners' portfolio. To keep the cost going up, owners screw the newcomer out of hard-earned cash. Blue states are uniquely intent on blocking housing development and ensuring what is built is built for the kind of people already there: that is to say, rich whites. This housing deficiency causes homelessness and the sickness endemic to the blue housing market.

## Further Reading
Right now, I am getting through the book [Goliath, by Matt Stoller](https://www.amazon.com/Goliath-100-Year-Between-Monopoly-Democracy/dp/1501183087?gQT=2). I'm not done yet, but what I've read is good, and I highly recommend
