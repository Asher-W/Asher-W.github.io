## The End of the Party
In the most famous quote in the bible, behind only a bunch of religious christian mumbo jumbo, Ecclesiastes reads "There is a time for everything, and a season for every activity under the heavens." In the same vein, there is is a time to talk about Abundance. That time was about a month ago, when people still cared about it. 
I'm talking about it now instead, because I'm a rebel WITH a cause. WITH A CAUSE. You could say it's because I'm lazy and bad at time management, but that would be slander and I would sue you. I'm serious, don't do it. That hurts my fragile ego.

This is all to say, I know I'm late to the party, but talking about the book is interesting, particularly because of its now slowing buzz. Many people have discussed the book, though I'm inclined to believe that far fewer have sat down and read it, not just because people today are reading less and less, but also because it sounds boring -- it's an economics book, what could be less enticing?

## Picking Abundance
Just about a month ago, I was arguing with my mother about Zohran Mamdani's policies. She said he was part of the "Abundance crowd" of people with ideas taken from or similar to the book. Knowing she hadn't read it, I asked what values the book espoused. All she could muster was "politics," and I wasn't much better. She wouldn't admit she didn't know, and I stood my ground, so we each got the book to settle our feud. She finished first, and I did soon after, but by then the tiff had died down.

A few days later, I was talking to my [friend](https://j-nac.github.io/2025/07/19/when-there-are-no-other-options.html) about the book. He admitted to me in confidence that he owned the book and had never read it. What's more, because he is completely illiterate and his brain is addled by trash tv, he asked me to write an article so he wouldn't have to read it. Since I am a kind, caring, altruistic pal to my good [buddy](https://j-nac.github.io/2025/05/12/exact-odes.html), we're here now.

## Getting Through the Book
It really must be said, Abundance, by Ezra Klein and Eric Thompson, is not the most complicated book in the world; far from it. It opens on a day in the authors' ideal future that feels straight from a YA sci-fi novel's okay fan-fiction. After they finish their fantasy, the authors say the following: 

>This book is dedicated to a simple idea: to have the future we want, we need to build and invent more of what we need. That's it. That's the thesis.
>
>It reads, even to us, as too simple.

This book is meant to be read, and read by everyone. It is no coincidence that a book like this has started a movement. This article is, in no way, a proper replacement for the actual book. So if you're reading this, (especially [you](https://j-nac.github.io/2025/05/30/potential-buffer-overflows.html)) I'm begging you. Please actually read the book.

With that out of the way, let's begin. The book has five large sections plus an intro and conclusion. These are: Introduction, Grow, Build, Govern, Invent, Deploy, and Conclusion. From here till otherwise noted, the points are from the book, though severely edited down.

### Introduction
The point of the book is simple, and they say it many times. Society is not broken, at least not in the traditional sense. Scarcity is a choice that we have made, and it is a decision we can change. 

The book here firmly sets itself as a letter to democrats, a so-called leftist party scared off of leftist policy, so bent to conservative whims that they repeat the right's talking points. For fear of being labeled socialist, democrats cut government to instead pass around ineffectual handouts. These handouts increase demand for goods, but without more supply, prices (of healthcare, college, everything) just go up. Many use this as an excuse to remove government, but markets cannot meet every need, so the government must occasionally intervene. Still, our government is barely functional in the best case. Without major reform, it cannot build a train, much less a future.

### Grow
Cities are extremely important to development. They gather the best minds to make progress in teams, they store industrial expertise in an easy to access bank, and they are fonts of social mobility. If we want to develop, we need our cities to thrive. But today, no one can afford them. Even when cities try to reform, they are blocked at every turn by old laws and [legal liberalism](https://lawreview.uchicago.edu/print-archive/new-legal-liberalism).

We build less homes per capita than most other countries, and what we build is absurdly expensive. In America, housing is an asset that makes up most of its owners' portfolio. To keep that cost up, owners screw the newcomer any way they can. Blue states specifically are uniquely intent on blocking housing development and ensuring what is built is built for the kind of people already there: that is to say, rich whites.

### Build
Energy today has a clear winner. Fossil fuels kill with fumes that green energy never produces. Installing a wind or solar source comes with half the cost for energy over a lifetime compared to coal. Tack on nuclear and geothermal, and there is plenty of good energy to go around. We just need to build it.
 
States like California have tried to build infrastructure, but almost always fail. They fail hard, but they fail slowly, and they pay all the way into the grave. People sue or lobby, regulations have to be met, and government money comes with conditions. Instead of getting better rail, for instance, these costs ensure there is none. We do not trust our government, and it is killing progress.

Liberalism has forgotten progress. It seeks legitimacy through rule following rather than successful governance, and so it breaks from its base.

### Govern
Public funds set strict requirements for projects that always slow development. These overflow budgets of both time and money, making it impossible for government to build. Almost nothing is exempted, no matter how important.

> The everything Bagel is, of course, the best bagel (pg. 113)

It is too late to take everything and wring our hands over how we get it: our laws need tight focus, not scattershot goals. Even as government fails to meet this organizational aim, they obsess with outsourcing everything to the private sector. Without capacity to oversee, understand, or push forward projects, government overspends and delays ad nauseam. If we trust our institutions and allow government to act, [projects that would take years can be finished in days](https://www.pa.gov/governor/newsroom/press-releases/governor-shapiro-gets-stuff-done--reopening-i-95-in-just-12-days). That we almost never do is a serious indictment of modern liberalism.

### Invent
Invention is the heart of progress, but it is difficult to control. In a depressing change from the 70s, research today is underappreciated and underfunded. Grant agencies like the NIH and NSF give their dime to projects they know will succeed. One problem is apparent here: good, novel science is, if nothing else, risky. Advancement comes from unlikely places: the window for [penicillin](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/health/the-real-story-behind-the-worlds-first-antibiotic), an unfunded but passionate scientist for [mRNA vaccines](https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/medicine/2023/kariko/facts/), random bacteria for [dna analysis](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK589663/) and [editing](https://medlineplus.gov/genetics/understanding/genomicresearch/genomeediting/), and gila monster venom for [ozempic](https://www.businessinsider.com/what-is-ozempic-glp1-drugs-developed-by-gila-monster-2023-3). None of these projects were guaranteed to be important, but they are nonetheless. 

Even when a project receives funding, [our politicians have ensured](https://www.forbes.com/sites/adamandrzejewski/2021/06/30/us-senator-william-proxmires-golden-fleece-award-turns-46-years-old/) it is overwhelmed by a glut of paperwork. These requirements mean researchers today spend up to 40% of their time on largely useless reports, wasting their time for no reason.

The unmentioned third government research agency, DARPA, is fundamentally different. Instead of working through a long grant process, it empowers experts to choose promising projects and make big bets. (some of them aided by CMU, pg. 162) It makes better science, and it makes it for pennies on the NIH dollar.

### Deploy
Making a discovery is one thing, but making it useful is another. The US excels at the former, yet we let our inventions slip to other countries when it comes time to make a product.

> Progress is more about implementation than it is about invention

When the free markets fail, governments have to step up to keep the ball rolling. In [Operation warp speed (OWS)](https://www.gao.gov/products/gao-21-319), government finally showed that it knew this. The government subsidized vaccine development and promised to buy successful product. Then they removed barriers to release while funding distribution. Thanks to this effort, what normally takes ten years was done in ten months. It was the best thing out of the Trump admin and a huge accomplishment, one Trump immediately abandoned in favor of conspiracy theories.

The key role of government in research is to remove bottlenecks. Good policy, like OWS, uses push funding -- loans, grants, loan guarantees -- and [pull funding](https://www.gatesfoundation.org/ideas/media-center/press-releases/2009/06/ministers-of-finance-and-global-health-leaders-fulfill-promise-to-combat-vaccinepreventable-killer) -- purchase guarantees called advance market commitments -- with regulation changes to incentivize and allow efficient invention. Passing these policies requires focus from the government; the kind of focus usually only stirred by a crisis, or something we decide is suitably [crisis-like](https://www.nasa.gov/history/sputnik/index.html).

### Conclusion 
We live in a once in a generation era of political tumult. Right now and not for very much longer, we can set a political order. If Democrats promise a good life and deliver, people will choose them. If not, right wing populism will take hold.

Democrats have done some things well. Where Trump failed to deliver infrastructure, Biden succeeded. The CHIPS act, despite flaws, broke the american tradition of stagnation and restarted construction. Biden's success continued with the inflation reduction act, another stimulus for construction. While Trump and the right are embrace scarcity, Democrats are finally adopting a lens of abundance. Instead of a reactionary liberalism, they are creating a "liberalism that builds."

## Further Reading
Right now, I am getting through the book [Goliath, by Matt Stoller](https://www.amazon.com/Goliath-100-Year-Between-Monopoly-Democracy/dp/1501183087?gQT=2). I'm not done yet, but what I've read is good, and I highly recommend taking a gander if you have some time to kill.
