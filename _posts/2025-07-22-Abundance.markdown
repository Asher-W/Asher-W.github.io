## The End of the Party
In the most famous quote in the bible, behind only a bunch of religious christian mumbo jumbo, Ecclesiastes reads "There is a time for everything, and a season for every activity under the heavens." In the same vein, there is is a time to talk about Abundance. That time was about a month ago, when people still cared about it. 
I'm talking about it now instead, because I'm a rebel WITH a cause. WITH A CAUSE. You could say it's because I'm lazy and bad at time management, but that would be slander and I would sue you. I'm serious, don't do it. That hurts my fragile ego.

This is all to say, I know I'm late to the party, but talking about the book is interesting, particularly because of its now slowing buzz. Many people have discussed the book, though I'm inclined to believe that far fewer have sat down and read it, not just because people today are reading less and less, but also because it sounds boring -- it's an economics book, what could be less enticing? This article will be an outline of the book, as well as my thoughts on its content.

## Picking Abundance
Just about a month ago, I was arguing with my mother about Zohran Mamdani's policies, which I am very excited to see implemented. She said he was part of the "Abundance crowd" of people with ideas taken from or similar to the book. Knowing she hadn't read it, I asked what values the book espoused. All she could muster was "politics," and I wasn't much better. She wouldn't admit she didn't know, and I stood my ground, so we each got the book to settle our feud. She finished first, and I did soon after, but by then the tiff had died down.

A few days later, I was talking to my [friend](https://j-nac.github.io/2025/07/19/when-there-are-no-other-options.html) about the book. He admitted to me in confidence that he owned the book and had never read it. What's more, because he is completely illiterate and his brain is addled by trash tv, he asked me to write an article so he wouldn't have to read it. Since I am a kind, caring, altruistic pal to my good [buddy](https://j-nac.github.io/2025/05/12/exact-odes.html), we're here now.

## Getting Through the Book
It really must be said, Abundance, by Ezra Klein and Eric Thompson, is not the most complicated book in the world; far from it. It opens on a day in the authors' ideal future that feels straight from a YA sci-fi novel's okay fan-fiction. In the first real line of the book, the authors say the following: 

>This book is dedicated to a simple idea: to have the future we want, we need to build and invent more of what we need. That's it. That's the thesis.
>
>It reads, even to us, as too simple.

This book is meant to be read, and read by everyone. It is no coincidence that a book like this would started a movement. This article is, in now way, a proper replacement for the actual book. So if you're reading this (especially [you](https://j-nac.github.io/2025/05/30/potential-buffer-overflows.html)) please actually read the book.

With that out of the way, lets begin. The book has five large sections plus an open and end. These are: Introduction, Grow, Build, Govern, Invent, Deploy, and Conclusion. From here till otherwise noted, the points are from the book, with editorializing by me.

### Introduction
The point of the book is simple, and they say it many times. Society is not broken, at least not in the traditional sense. Scarcity is a choice that we have made, and it is a decision we can change. 

The book here firmly sets itself as a letter to democrats, a so-called leftist party scared off of leftist policy, so bent to conservative whims that they repeat the right's talking point. For fear of being labeled socialist, democrats cut government to instead pass around ineffectual handouts. These handouts increase demand for goods, but without more made, prices (of healthcare, college, everything) just go up. Yet the markets won't always meet people's needs, so the government must do something. To grow more than before, we have to change culture and develop new fields, and that takes work. It takes research that we aren't doing. Our party must look to the future and allow government to be effective if we hope to regain the populace's trust.

### Grow
Cities are extremely important to development. They gather the best minds to make progress in teams, they store industrial expertise in an easy to access bank, and they are fonts of social mobility. If we want to develop, we need them to thrive. But today, no one can afford them.

Seventy years ago, America was disgusting, was ugly, was killing its people off like clay pigeons at a shooting range. Fewer than ten years after laws were passed to address this issue, they became yet more tools to block development of housing.

We build less homes per capita than most other countries, and what we build is absurdly expensive. Housing is an asset that makes up most of its owners' portfolio. To keep the cost going up, owners screw the newcomer out of their hard-earned cash. Blue states are uniquely intent on blocking housing development and ensuring what is built is built for the kind of people already there: that is to say, rich whites. This housing deficiency causes homelessness and the sickness endemic to the blue housing market.

### Build
Energy today has a clear winner. Fossil fuels kill with fumes that green energy never produces. Solar and wind are as cheap as they've ever been and only getting cheaper. Installing a wind or energy source comes with half the cost for energy over a lifetime compared to coal, and solar even beats natural gas. Tack on nuclear and geothermal, and there is plenty of green energy to go around. We just need to build it.
 
States like California try to build infrastructure, but almost always fail. They fail hard, but they fail slowly, and they pay all the way into the grave. People sue or lobby, regulations have to be met, and government money comes with conditions. Instead of getting better rail, for instance, these costs ensure there is none. We don't trust our government, and it's killing progress.

Liberalism has forgotten progress. It seeks legitimacy through rules rather than successful governance.

### Govern
Projects taking public funds have to follow strict requirements that slow development. These overflow budgets of both time and money, making it impossible for government to build. Almost no projects are exempted.

> The everything Bagel is, of course, the best bagel (pg. 113)

It is too late to take everything and wring our hands over how we get it: our laws need tight focus, not scattershot goals. When Biden issued his semiconductor funding opportunity to reduce the cost of building in America, he included core environmental stipulations and diversity requirements. These tradeoffs compete with the rest of the bill to render its funding ineffectual.

Governments are obsessed with outsourcing everything to the private sector. Without capacity to oversee, understand, or push forward their projects, government overspends and delays ad nauseam. If we trust our institutions and allow government to act, [projects that would take years can be finished in days](https://www.pa.gov/governor/newsroom/press-releases/governor-shapiro-gets-stuff-done--reopening-i-95-in-just-12-days).

### Invent
Invention is the heart of progress, but it is difficult to harness and control. In a depressing change from the 70s, research today is underappreciated, underfunded, and poorly guided. Funding foundations only give their dime to projects they know will succeed, and so nothing risky is tried. Good, novel science is, if nothing else, risky. Advancement comes from the most unlikely places: the window for [penicillin](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/health/the-real-story-behind-the-worlds-first-antibiotic), an unfunded but passionate scientist for [mRNA vaccines](https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/medicine/2023/kariko/facts/), a random bacteria for [dna analysis](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK589663/) or [editing](https://medlineplus.gov/genetics/understanding/genomicresearch/genomeediting/), gila monster venom for [ozempic](https://www.businessinsider.com/what-is-ozempic-glp1-drugs-developed-by-gila-monster-2023-3), etc. Even when a project receives funding, [our politicians have ensured](https://www.forbes.com/sites/adamandrzejewski/2021/06/30/us-senator-william-proxmires-golden-fleece-award-turns-46-years-old/) it is overwhelmed by a glut of paperwork. Scientists today spend up to 40% of their time on reports, rather than doing the research we all need, and approval takes even longer.

As science progresses, new ideas are becoming harder to discover. We need to facilitate research, and that takes big changes. We need to allow in immigrants that contribute to our research, to fix our broken funding system, and to look to new frontiers.

The most successful government research agency of late, DARPA, is fundamentally different. Instead of working through a long grant process, it empowers experts to choose promising projects and make big bets. (some of them aided by CMU pg. 162) This same formula was applied at Bell labs in the 50s onwards to the same result. It makes better science.

### Deploy
Making a discovery is one thing, but making it useful is entirely separate. The US excels at the former, yet we let our inventions slip to other countries when it comes time to make a product. Development is as much a series of "microinventions" added on later it as it is the original discovery. Our politicians refuse to hold onto development in America.

> Progress is more about implementation than it is about invention

When the free markets fail, governments have to step up to keep the ball rolling. [Operation warp speed (OWS)](https://www.gao.gov/products/gao-21-319) was one of the most successful instances of this tactic working. The government subsidized development and promised to buy successful product while removing barriers to release and funding or running distribution, and through this ensured the fastest development of any vaccine ever. They had a plan and the employees to do it well, and it worked. It was the best thing out of the Trump admin and a huge accomplishment, one Trump immediately abandoned in favor of conspiracy theories.

The key role of government in research is to remove bottlenecks. Good policy, like OWS, uses push funding -- loans, grants, loan guarantees -- and [pull funding](https://www.gatesfoundation.org/ideas/media-center/press-releases/2009/06/ministers-of-finance-and-global-health-leaders-fulfill-promise-to-combat-vaccinepreventable-killer) -- purchase guarantees called advance market commitments -- with regulation changes to incentivize and allow efficient invention. Passing these policies requires focus from the government; the kind of focus usually stirred by a crisis. The good news is that we decide what counts as a crisis.

### Conclusion 
We live now in a once in a generation era of political tumult. Right now and not for very much longer, we can guide what policy on all sides will look like for the next 60 years. If our side is successful and promises a good life, people will choose it. If not, right wing populist authoritarianism in the style of Donald Trump will take hold.

We've done some things well. Where Trump failed to deliver infrastructure, biden succeeded. The CHIPS act, despite flaws, broke the american tradition of stagnation and restarted building. This continued with the inflation reduction act, another very successful stimulus for building. While Trump and the right are embrace scarcity, democrats are finally adopting the lens of abundance. We are in the middle of a painful path to full adoption, but we continue to shape our liberalism that builds.

## A Few Thoughts
Abundance really is a great book. There were so many more examples that didn't fit in this format but are very interesting to consider, including a deeper dive into California's rail problem and Reagan's terrible policies. It was worth the read, if just to be able to tell people what the book is actually about.

## Further Reading
Right now, I am getting through the book [Goliath, by Matt Stoller](https://www.amazon.com/Goliath-100-Year-Between-Monopoly-Democracy/dp/1501183087?gQT=2). I'm not done yet, but what I've read is good, and I highly recommend taking a gander if you have some time to kill.
