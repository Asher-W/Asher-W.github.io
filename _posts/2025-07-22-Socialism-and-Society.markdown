## An Interesting Question
A few days ago, my [friend](https://j-nac.github.io/blog) and I had a political conversation. He asked me whether it was depressing that the left, as it stands, advocates mostly to fix problems, rather than to make progress. At the time, I didn't have a great retort, but I've a few thoughts since that lend themselves to pring. Government, as I see it, has two core functions, to keep order and to encourage change.

## The Easier Job
The first issue we’ve largely “solved.” Government always uses the same sort of structured laws imposed by force, be it military or police, anywhere you look. Aside from a few niche instances, you rarely see groups agitating against the idea, just a specific blemish of its application. There are other ways to do it that could work, ie shaming or social pressures, but no one pushes for that. 

## The Harder Job
The second is where legislatures mostly disagree (outside of blatant corruption or myopia). For instance, the government cares about economics because it is a really good tool to motivate evolution. Debates arise from how the tool should be leveraged, with the right promoting a completely free market and the left (supposedly) promoting socialism. 

### The Case from the Right
A necessary condition for true right wing free markets is a lack of social nets to meet basic needs, which the right charitably believes serves as the ultimate motivator for progress. Naively, it makes sense. Who would work harder for food than a starving man? 

### The Case from the Left
Socialism, on the other hand, meets the basic needs of the people, no matter what. Many people, given these descriptions, hear possibility in the first and bland problem management in the second; that is wrong. 

## Choosing a Side
The most important point is that government itself has never made an invention. The knowledgable reader might bring up radar, sonar, wifi, but saying those misses the point. No law drove a screw, no bureaucrat wrote a line of code. Researchers made the progress, not government officials. So why do we see free markets as such a boon? 

### Capitalism and Propaganda
Because we’ve done many really cool things as a country, and we’ve been pro free market for all of it. Therefore, Americans have incorrectly conflated progress and right wing free markets. It’s just always been the pattern. Nevertheless, they are not the same thing.

### My Case for the Left
When I said before that right wing free markets made sense naively, I truly meant only naively. In practice, people work much better when their needs are met. When the fed man and the man starving race for food, it doesn’t matter how hard the starving man tries, he can’t physically win. 

## Concluding Thoughts
To the question, it is not as big of an issue as you might think that the socialist goal is just to fix issues and do nothing further. They would benefit from more funding to research, but all we need is for government to give us a net and some resources and then get out of the way.
