I’m at the end of the rope, and the noose keeps tightening, and I feel like I’m dying, but I have to keep trying. I try to run, but my feet find air. I claw at my throat and pray to god to let me go, but the noose keeps tightening and I keep dying. My neck is bloody and bruised, but I can’t stop pulling, and the noose won’t stop tightening. It pulls tighter and tighter, and then…
A wet snap rushes through the square, heard only by an audience of one: the corpse hanging on the rope. And the corpse doesn’t claw, the corpse doesn’t pray. The corpse is content just to swing from the gallows, a lesson to those who dare to try, until the hangman takes it down and throws it in a ditch with all the other failures.

God casts our mortal die and tells our story, and it would be inane to look him in the eye and ask for more, but what else should I do? How do I content myself with misery?
